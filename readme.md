# My Portfolio

### Assignment

Create a portfolio of your time at BeCode with CSS grid and Sass.

### Dependencies

  - Sass
  - Awesome Font
  - Github
  
### The site itself

I decided to go for a clean looking mosaic portfolio where the pictures take up the main spotlight.
I also linked my Github and Linked-in.
In the navbar I also added some more tabs, which I am planning to make.
